Description: This package is intended for users with minimal R 
    experience or knowledge. The package is intended to make it easier to 
    compare latent class and latent profile mixture models
    using Mplus. Instead of generating each input file in Mplus 
    individually, the package batch creates
    and runs these for you based on the dataset input. 
    Additionally, it autogenerates fit tables.
    Eventually it will also run EFA. The package requires Mplus.

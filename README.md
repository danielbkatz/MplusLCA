# MplusLCA
For running lots of basic Latent Class Analyses (LCA) in R. This package was meant to be used locally and within a research group as a simple way to generate scripts that run LCA in `MPlus` and then aggregates results.
The package batch runs and tabulates Latent Class and Latent Profile Analysis in `Mplus` via R.
